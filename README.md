# project-topaz

## Background
The non-profit organization Finance to Education (F2E) was founded to support financial needs for students who may not be able to continue education. The applicants will be pre-verified by coordinators before submitting a formal application. A verified student has to maintain a certain level of academic performance and submit an academic report each semester in order to continue the funding. All of the tuition and fees are paid directly to the educational institution. Other allowance for routine expenses will be tracked to ensure that it is not misused. All donors will also receive an annual report of the students sent by F2E. Since all of these highly manual processes are not scalable and very time-consuming, it is important for F2E to convert the manual activities to automated processes by developing an automated information system.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to help F2E by building an automated system for students to learn and get funding, and for mentors and donors to track students' academic status. It is designed with a client application in order to help F2E to have better interactions with students, mentors and donors.
